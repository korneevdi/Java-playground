# Java Core

This repository contains a collection of small learning projects and practice modules created as I study and explore core Java concepts.
It is not intended as a portfolio or production-ready codebase — rather, it serves as a structured space for experimentation, 
safe storage of my practice code, and a convenient way to access it from anywhere.

Feel free to explore and use!

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

 - Practice and reinforce Java fundamentals
 - Keep learning projects organized in separate modules
 - Store examples remotely for backup and easy access
 - Gradually build a structured personal knowledge base

## Current Modules

The repository already includes several thematic modules, such as:

 - [Annotations](./Annotations)
    - Using annotations in Java with simple examples.
 - [Collections](./Collections)
    - Implementation of the main classes and methods in Java Collections Framework including Map hierarchy.
    - [Java Collections Framework diagram](https://github.com/korneevdi/Java-playground/blob/main/Collection/JCF_Structure.md).
    - [Map Hierarchy in Java Collections Framework](https://github.com/korneevdi/Java-playground/blob/main/Collection/Map_Structure.md).
 - [JDBC-airport-management](./JDBC-airport-management)
    - Practicing database connections, queries, and statements without using frameworks like Hibernate.
    - Core of my future portfolio project for airport management

## Upcoming Modules

More topics will be added soon, for example:

 - Reflection
 - Exceptions
 - Multithreading & Concurrency
 - Generics
 - I/O & NIO
 - and many others…

Each topic will be placed in its own module to keep the repository clean and easy to navigate.

## Notes

All projects here are purely educational. Some examples may be simplified or experimental, focusing on specific concepts rather than completeness or optimization.
